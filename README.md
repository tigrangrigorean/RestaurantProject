The service interfaces include methods for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting entities. These methods provide the necessary business logic for the application.
### **REPOSITORY Package**
The REPOSITORY package contains repository interfaces that extend the JpaRepository interface for performing database operations. These interfaces provide methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and additional queries.

The repository interfaces include:

- UserRepository: Performs database operations for the User entity.
- RestaurantRepository: Performs database operations for the Restaurant entity.
- AddressRepository: Performs database operations for the Address entity.
- OrderRepository: Performs database operations for the Order entity.
- MenuRepository: Performs database operations for the Menu entity.

These interfaces inherit common methods from JpaRepository, such as findById(), findAll(), save(), deleteById(), etc., which allow for easy database interaction.
### **MODEL Package**
The MODEL package contains DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and domain entities representing the data structure of the application.

1. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs): These objects are used for transferring data between the API layer and the service layer. They have similar attributes to the corresponding domain entities but are tailored for specific use cases. The DTOs include:
   1. RestaurantDTO: Contains information about a restaurant, such as name, TIN, address ID, manager ID, found date, registration date, phone number, and email.
   1. UserDTO: Represents a user and includes attributes such as first name, last name, address ID, birthday, phone number, password, email, passport number, and role.
   1. AddressDTO: Represents an address and includes attributes such as city, street, building, and apartment.
   1. FoodDTO: Represents a food item and includes attributes such as name, ingredients, price, and restaurant ID.
   1. OrderDTO: Represents an order and includes attributes such as price, a list of food IDs, order status, and restaurant name.
1. Domain Entities: These entities represent the database tables and are used for persistence. They include additional attributes and associations compared to the DTOs. The domain entities include:
   1. RestaurantEntity: Represents a restaurant and includes attributes such as ID, name, TIN, associated address entity, associated user entity, found date, registration date, phone number, email, and a list of associated food entities.
   1. UserEntity: Represents a user and includes attributes such as ID, first name, last name, associated address entity, birthday, phone number, password, email, passport number, role, and a list of associated restaurant entities.
   1. AddressEntity: Represents an address and includes attributes such as ID, city, street, building, and apartment.
   1. FoodEntity: Represents a food item and includes attributes such as ID, name, ingredients, price, and associated restaurant entity.
   1. OrderEntity: Represents an order and includes attributes such as ID, price, a list of associated food entities, order status, and restaurant name.

The DTOs are used for transferring data between the API and service layers, while the domain entities represent the database structure and are used for persistence and data retrieval.
### **Enumerations**
The project utilizes enumerations to represent certain types of data. The enumerations include:

- Role: Represents different user roles such as ROLE\_USER, ROLE\_ADMIN, ROLE\_MANAGER, and ROLE\_DELIVERY\_MAN.
  - ROLE\_USER: Represents a user role with basic permissions to make orders.
  - ROLE\_ADMIN: Represents an admin role with elevated permissions to control all restaurants, accept restaurant applications, accept manager applications, and has all permissions of managers and users.
  - ROLE\_MANAGER: Represents a manager role with permissions to manage a specific restaurant and has all permissions of users.
  - ROLE\_DELIVERY\_MAN: Represents a delivery personnel role with limited permissions to deliver food.
- OrderStatus: Represents different order statuses such as ACCEPTED, PENDING, IN\_DELIVERY, DELIVERED, and REJECTED.
  - ACCEPTED: Indicates that the order has been accepted.
  - PENDING: Indicates that the order has been accepted, and the food is being prepared.
  - IN\_DELIVERY: Indicates that the food has left the restaurant and is being delivered.
  - DELIVERED: Indicates that the user has received the order.
  - REJECTED: Indicates that the payment for the order did not pass correctly.

These enumerations provide a structured way to represent and handle specific types of data in the application.
